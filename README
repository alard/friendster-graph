Download Friendster friend lists, to investigate the Friendster social network.

This script will contact a central tracker to get an id range (of 10,000 Friendster
ids at a time). It will then download the friends lists for these users and parse
them to extract the user ids of the friends. The list of connections for each user
will be saved to a local file and submitted back to the tracker.
This process takes between 200 to 300 seconds for each range of 10,000 ids. The
html pages it downloads are fairly large, but the resulting list of friends is
much smaller.

To run this script you need the typhoeus gem:

  gem install typhoeus

Then run

  ruby bff-graph-client.rb

If you press any key, the script will complete the current range and exit.
